This SQL query is used to generate a summary report from a table named 'query_2664816', which presumably contains transaction data related to 'Starknet', a term associated with blockchain technology.

Here's a breakdown of what the query does:

1. It selects 'Starknet' as a static text under the column 'type'. This is likely used to label the data in the resulting report.

2. It counts the total number of rows (transactions) in the table and labels this count as 'tx_cnt'.

3. It counts the number of distinct 'l1_user_address' values, which likely represent unique users. This count is labeled as 'user_cnt'.

4. It sums up the 'amount_usd' values for rows where 'action' is 'Deposit'. This represents the total amount of deposits in USD and is labeled as 'deposit_amount_usd'.

5. It sums up all 'amount_usd' values, regardless of the 'action' value. This represents the total balance in USD and is labeled as 'balance_amount_usd'.

6. The 'group by 1' clause groups the results by the first column in the select statement, which is 'type'. Since 'type' is a static text ('Starknet'), this effectively means that the query will return a single row of summary statistics for 'Starknet'.

In summary, this query provides a summary of the total number of transactions, the number of unique users, the total deposit amount in USD, and the total balance amount in USD for 'Starknet'.
